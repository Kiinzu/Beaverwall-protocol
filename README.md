As technology continues to advance, physical documents are often overlooked in favor of digital formats. However, this can come with its own set of challenges, such as the risk of loss or fraud. Valuable documents like passports, ownership certificates, and ID cards are particularly vulnerable. For example, ownership of land can be easily forged, and in developing countries, there may not be a clear record of ownership to begin with. Losing such a document can be a permanent and difficult problem to solve.   

Fortunately, the **Beaverwall-Protocol** was created to address these issues. This protocol uses Blockchain technology to store important documents as smart contracts on the network. By creating a smart contract for your document using your name and key, you can secure and store it on the network. This allows you to track the history of the document and ensure its safety. The program can also be used for private purposes, such as recording data and events in a company to maintain the integrity of important documents.

### Stage-1
Stage 1 of this project is to create the logic behind the program, currently I'm using python to create the basic code and a **credentials.txt** as its' Database.
